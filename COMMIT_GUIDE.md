## 📝 **Recommended Commit Strategy**

For best practices, I recommend using **commits 1-12** separately as they:
- ✅ Maintain clean Git history
- ✅ Allow easy rollback of specific features
- ✅ Enable better code review process
- ✅ Follow conventional commit standards
- ✅ Make debugging easier by isolating changes

## 🏷️ **Optional: Add Tags for Releases**
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial release of Employee Retention Prediction System"
git push origin v1.0.0
```
